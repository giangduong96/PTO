# According to the Wikipedia’s article: “The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.”
#
# Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
#
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population…
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
# Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: 
# [
#   [0,1,0],
#   [0,0,1],
#   [1,1,1],
#   [0,0,0]
# ]
# Output: 
# [
#   [0,0,0],
#   [1,0,1],
#   [0,1,1],
#   [0,1,0]
# ]
#
# Follow up:
#
# Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
# In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?
#
# Follow up 2 : Infinite Board
# So far we've only addressed one of the follow-up questions for this problem statement. We saw how to perform the simulation according to the four rules in-place i.e. without using any additional memory. The problem statement also mentions another follow-up statement which is a bit open ended. We will look at two possible solutions to address it. Essentially, the second follow-up asks us to address the scalability aspect of the problem. What would happen if the board is infinitely large? Can we still use the same solution that we saw earlier or is there something else we will have to do different? If the board becomes infinitely large, there are multiple problems our current solution would run into:

# It would be computationally impossible to iterate a matrix that large.
# It would not be possible to store that big a matrix entirely in memory. We have huge memory capacities these days i.e. of the order of hundreds of GBs. However, it still wouldn't be enough to store such a large matrix in memory.
# We would be wasting a lot of space if such a huge board only has a few live cells and the rest of them are all dead. In such a case, we have an extremely sparse matrix and it wouldn't make sense to save the board as a "matrix".
# Such open ended problems are better suited to design discussions during programming interviews and it's a good habit to take into consideration the scalability aspect of the problem since your interviewer might be interested in talking about such problems. The discussion section already does a great job at addressing this specific portion of the problem. We will briefly go over two different solutions that have been provided in the discussion sections, as they broadly cover two main scenarios of this problem.
#
# One aspect of the problem is addressed by a great solution provided by Stefan Pochmann. So as mentioned before, it's quite possible that we have a gigantic matrix with a very few live cells. In that case it would be stupidity to save the entire board as is.
#
# If we have an extremely sparse matrix, it would make much more sense to actually save the location of only the live cells and then apply the 4 rules accordingly using only these live cells.
