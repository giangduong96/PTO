# 287. Find the Duplicate Number
# Medium
#
# Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
# Output: 2
# Example 2:
#
# Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
# Output: 3
# Note:
#
# You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
# You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
# Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
# There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
### Note
# The first two approaches mentioned do not satisfy the constraints given in the prompt, but they are solutions that you might be likely to come up with during a technical interview. As an interviewer, I personally would not expect someone to come up with the cycle detection solution unless they have heard it before.
